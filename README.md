Welcome to my internship project repository for ** CodSoft **.
This repository contains the tasks I completed as a part of my virtual internship in the domain of **Web Development**.

## Overview

This internship focused on improving practical skills in front-end and basic back-end development. The tasks were designed to simulate real-world scenarios and enhance problem-solving abilities. Each task is stored in its own folder with source code and additional notes if necessary.

A responsive landing page designed for the band ** Lord Huron **. Built with HTML and CSS to match the band's indie-folk vibe.

### Task 3: Calculator App

A simple yet functional calculator web app built using JavaScript. It handles basic arithmetic operations.
